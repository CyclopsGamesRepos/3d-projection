# Projection from 3D to 2D for Mathematics & Graphics

## What this project aims to deliver
- Project a 3D model into a 2D image in a Unity scene
- Move camera around the scene and show what it looks like from different vantage points.

## How it does it
- All vector and matrices mathematics code has been created by us. Nothing from Unity is used for these transformations!
- Image projected into scene has been transformed with 100% independent code created by us.

## Nice to haves

- When we move the camera, it calls our functions and moves it around the screen.

## Created by:
- Calin Clement O'Ceallaigh
